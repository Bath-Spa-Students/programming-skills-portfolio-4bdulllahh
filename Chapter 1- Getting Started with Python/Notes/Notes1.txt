the -----> print("") <----- command is used to give output of what ever you wrote 
  whatever you write in ---> ("") <--- will be the output print 

\n <--- writing this will move the text to the next line
\t <--- writing this will leave 8 blank spaces 

for writing multiple line code we can either use 2 double qoutes 1 one each side of the text and use \n and \t to move lines or leave spaces
or
we can use 6 double quotes 3 on each side or 6 single quotes 3 on each side 
        eg. print("""xyz""") or print('''xyz''')
we can then write the text in diffrent lines and leave spaces 
        and it will come out as written 
        eg. 
            print("""xyz abc                                     
            Abdullah                     
                    yes and no
                    end)

                  ~output~-

                    xyz abc                                     
            Abdullah                     
                    yes and no
                    end


changing the double quotes to single quote will give the same output as well

the use of \n and \t was shown in Practise1 in Excercise1
the use of the quote method was used in Practise2 in Excercise1.
