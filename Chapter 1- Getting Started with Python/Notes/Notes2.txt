First use ---> import <--- command to import sys module 
'sys' is an inbuilt module in Python
the 'sys' module gives access to diffrent system specific functions and parameter
 print("Python version: ")
  this prints the text 'Python version: ' so we can show that the current python version will be printed next
print(sys.version)
  this print out the version of python 
  it does not give out the ouput as 'sys.version' 
  because it is not written in double quotes
it reads the the sys module and prints out the version instead 
print("Version info: ")
  this prints 'Version info. ' so we can show that the version info will be printed next
print(sys.version_info)
 this will give the output in a tuple containing 5 components 
       Major, Minor, Micro Releaselevel and Serial 

 Major : This component represents the major version number of Python. For example, in Python 3.7.2, the major version is 3.
 Minor : The minor version number indicates smaller, backward-compatible changes in the language or standard library.
          For example, in Python 3.7.2, the minor version is 7.      
 Micro : The micro version, also known as the patch version, represents bug fixes and smaller changes.
         In Python 3.7.2, the micro version is 2.  
 Releaselevel : This component provides information about the release level. 
                It can have values like "alpha," "beta," "candidate," or "final" to denote the development status of Python.
                Most Python versions are marked as "final" for stable releases.  
 Serial : The serial component is an integer that represents the specific build for the Python version.
         It's typically set to 0 for stable releases. 

So the output will look something like this 
sys.version_info(major=3, minor=8, micro=1, releaselevel='final', serial=0)     <-----------
