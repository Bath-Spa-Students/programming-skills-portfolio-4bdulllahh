Method 1 ----> using the '+' operator
first we create 3 strings
string1 = "X "
string2 = "Y "
string3 = "Z "

next we combine the strings using operators 
here we use the plus operator '+'
  eg. 
     combined_string = string1 + string2 + string3

then we print 
  print(combined_string)

Output will come out as 
    X Y Z   

Method 2 ----> Using string formatting 
first we create 3 strings
string1 = "X "
string2 = "Y "
string3 = "Z "

 We create a string that includes placeholders {} where we want to insert the values of the individual strings.
   In this case, we use a string with three placeholders.
   Like 
   combined_string = "{}{}{}".format(string1, string2, string3)
    
the '.format()' method is called on the string containing placeholders, and it replaces each placeholders with the values provided in the '.format()' function
which are the string1, string2 and string3.

Print the output
 print(combined_string)
Output will come out as 

 ---> X Y Z
