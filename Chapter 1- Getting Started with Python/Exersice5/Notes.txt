Excercise 5
first we use the 'import' command to import 'math' module
this provides us the value of pi π as we need it in the calculation

then we need an input from the user 
so we use 
  radius = float(input("Enter the radius of the circle: "))
  we use float because it allows us to write a rational number eg. 1.4, 13.54, 255.34
  we use the input commmand because it asks the user to interact and write a number down
  which we will use as the value of the radius 

for the equation
 we write 
  area = math.pi * (radius ** 2 )
   the equation to find the area of a circle is π multiplied by radius raised to the power 2 
   to add the value of π we write 'math.pi'
   we mutiply it with 
   radius raised to the power 2 
   so we write use the '*' operator and write it as 
     'radius ** 2'

to further round the answer we can 

Method 1 ---> using the round() funtion
we can write 
rounded_area = (area, 2) 
this round the decimal points to 2 decimal places     
then 
print(rounded_area)

Method 2 ---> using the string formatting 
we can write 
rounded_area = "{:.2f}".format(area)
the '{:.2f} is a format string
this code formats the 'area' as a string with 2 decimal places
then stores it in 'rounded_area'
then
print(rounded_area)
