the -----> print("") <----- command is used to give output of what ever you wrote 
  whatever you write in ---> ("") <--- will be the output print 

\n <--- writing this will move the text to the next line
\t <--- writing this will leave 8 blank spaces 

for writing multiple line code we can either use 2 double qoutes 1 one each side of the text and use \n and \t to move lines or leave spaces
or
we can use 6 double quotes 3 on each side or 6 single quotes 3 on each side 
        eg. print("""xyz""") or print('''xyz''')
